# Dependencies

None of the packages contains the back-end, zerotier-one. Arch has it in the `community` repo. For Ubuntu based distributions, you'll need to install it manually [from their website](https://www.zerotier.com/download/). On top of that, you'll need python3.6 or greater, and the tkinter module. This however should be handled by the packaging software. Service management depends on SystemD. You will **not** be able to enable or disable the ZeroTier service without it.
